# Photosnap multi-page website

I have built the marketing site for a photo-sharing app.
The website is responsive, you can use it on your phone, tablet or normal desktop.

## TechStack

- React
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS custom properties

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
